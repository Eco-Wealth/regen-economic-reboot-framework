# ReFi Bridge Allocation Policy (Community Pool) v0.1

## Goal
Use the CommunityShare portion of FeeRouter inflows to (1) strengthen liquidity and (2) incentivize measurable contributions that increase ecological throughput on Regen.

## Default Allocation Targets (configurable by governance)
- ReFiDAO: 30%
- Kolektivo: 20%
- Toucan: 20%
- Commons Stack / governance tooling: 10%
- Open grants pool (new partners): 20%

## Eligibility (minimum)
- Demonstrated integration work OR verified contributions tied to Regen registry throughput within the epoch.

## Concentration guardrails
- Max allocation per partner: 30% per epoch
- Any new partner requires a governance-approved recipient entry

## Epoch cadence
- Mainnet: 90 days
- Testnet: shortened (configurable) to accelerate validation

## Reporting
Every epoch distribution MUST produce:
- Recipient list + amounts
- On-chain tx hashes
- KPI notes (throughput, liquidity, governance participation)
