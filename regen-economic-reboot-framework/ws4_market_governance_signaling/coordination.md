# Coordination Framework for Regen Economic Reboot

This document defines how Workstream 4 maintains ongoing coordination between Regen's R&D, Foundation, and GaiaAI simulation layers.

## Feedback Loop
1. Community input and proposals (via GitHub Discussions, Common, or governance threads)
2. GaiaAI synthesis into draft specifications or simulations
3. R&D review → technical validation
4. Foundation publishes updated roadmap sections

**Principle:** Transparent, AI-assisted iteration ensures Regen’s tokenomics evolve as open infrastructure.
