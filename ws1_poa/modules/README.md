# Module Scaffolds

This folder contains *design scaffolds* for two proposed modules:

- `x/authority`: governance-curated authority registry + validator set publishing
- `x/compensation`: fee routing + validator compensation

These are **not** wired into a Cosmos SDK app in this repo.
They are intended to guide implementation within `regen-ledger`.
